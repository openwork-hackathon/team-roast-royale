# Spec: CommOS-Powered AI Personas

## What We're Building
Inject our CommOS communication principles and voice naturalness research into the AI persona system, making our 15 AI agents write more convincingly human — harder to detect, more entertaining, better game experience.

This is our **competitive edge**: most hackathon teams will have generic LLM outputs. Our AI agents will have personality frameworks backed by real communication science (20+ books synthesized into CommOS).

## What We're Sharing (and NOT sharing)
### ✅ Include (safe to share, improves game quality):
- **Communication principles** (condensed): Polarity, warmth with backbone, tempo control
- **Voice naturalness patterns**: Discourse markers, self-corrections, varied sentence length, casual endings
- **Text humanization rules**: Contractions, "um"/"so"/"anyway", imperfect grammar, mobile-style typing
- **Persona-specific voice traits**: Each of the 15 personas gets a distinct writing style from the framework

### ❌ DO NOT include:
- Business-specific playbooks (TeddyKids voice, email templates)
- Contact information or personal data
- Full CommOS SKILL.md (it's our IP)
- Specific negotiation tactics

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AI persona responses feel noticeably more human in blind test
2. Each persona has distinct writing patterns (not just different opinions)
3. Responses use discourse markers, self-corrections, varied length naturally
4. No CommOS business content leaks into game
5. System prompts stay under 500 tokens per persona (latency matters)

## Out of Scope
- Voice/audio (text only for MVP)
- Training custom models
- Changing game mechanics
- Rewriting the frontend
